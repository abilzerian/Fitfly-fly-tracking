Contained in this folder are...

1) "test_mv" - A sample 15 second clip of 100+ flies walking in a back-illuminated square chamber
2) "params" - A matlab structure containing the results of the "get_video_params" code which is used in the "fitfly_video_tracking" code to track the positions of the flies.
3) "results" - A matlab file containing the variable "ResMat" which labels the positions of each fly in each frame. This is the output of the "fitfly_video_tracking" code.
